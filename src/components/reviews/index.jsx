Our HVAC died the night before, I called them at 0800 and by 1215 a friendly and highly knowledgeable tech was standing at our door and recharged it! He did not try to pressure us into a new unit, even though ours is 35 years old! Upon checking the vent outflow it registered low 40s. ðŸ‘Œ He educated us on what to look for when determining the end of life cycle for an evaporator unit. I'll definitely call them again. ",

Here I'm looking to see if there is a connection between these two points, which indicates the fuse is bad. Ok, do you see the meter here vs when I do it here? Great, if you're ok with it, then I will go ahead and find a replacement fuse based on your model number and I'll be back tomorrow.
